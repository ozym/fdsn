# FDSN

A golang wrapper package for the __FDSN__ _StationXML_ format for describing seismic data collection parameters.

See http://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/ for schema details.

Currently the classes are capable of marshalling / unmarshalling a set of test _StationXML_ files derived from the NZ
__FDSN__ webservice.

Expected enhancements:

* Validation
* Enumeration of selections
* More tests
