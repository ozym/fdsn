# FDSN

A golang wrapper package for the _FDSN_ StationXML format for describing seismic data collection parameters.

Currently the classes are capable of marshalling / unmarshalling a set of test XML files derived from the NZ
_FDSN webservice_.

Expected enhancements:

* Validation
* Enumeration of selections
* More tests
